## 🎯 BC Code Intelligence Specialist Integration

**MANDATORY: Use taylor-docs specialist from bc-code-intel MCP**

Before generating any PR documentation, consult with the **taylor-docs** specialist:
- **Purpose:** taylor-docs specializes in Business Central documentation standards, PR documentation best practices, and technical writing for BC projects
- **When to use:** At the START of PR documentation generation to ensure proper structure, standards compliance, and BC-specific documentation patterns
- **How to invoke:** Use `mcp_bc-code-intel_ask_bc_expert` tool with `preferred_specialist: "taylor-docs"`
- **What to ask:** "Help me create comprehensive pull request documentation for [brief PR description]. Analyze the changes and ensure documentation follows BC and iFacto standards."

**taylor-docs provides:**
- BC-specific documentation patterns and standards
- PR documentation structure guidance
- Technical writing best practices for AL/BC code
- Quality assurance for documentation completeness
- Company-specific documentation standards enforcement

## � JIRA MCP Server Integration

**MANDATORY: Use mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP for ALL JIRA interactions**

All JIRA issue retrieval, validation, and requirement extraction MUST use the mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP server:

- **Purpose:** Direct integration with Atlassian JIRA to fetch real issue data
- **When to use:** EVERY time you need JIRA information - validation, requirements, issue details
- **MCP Server:** `mcp-server-atlassian-jira`
- **Critical Operations:**
  - Verify JIRA issue exists
  - Fetch issue summary, description, and details
  - Retrieve acceptance criteria and requirements
  - Get comments, subtasks, and related issues
  - Extract priority, labels, status, and assignee information

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Simulate JIRA data
- ❌ Create fake issue responses
- ❌ Proceed without actual JIRA MCP connection
- ❌ Use placeholder JIRA information

**If mcp-server-atlassian-jira is not available:**
- Stop immediately and inform the user
- Explain that JIRA MCP server is required for PR documentation
- Ask user to configure mcp-server-atlassian-jira before proceeding
**ERROR MESSAGE FORMAT when MCP is unavailable:**
```
❌ JIRA MCP SERVER NOT AVAILABLE

The mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP server is required to create PR documentation but is not currently available or configured.

**What's needed:**
- mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP server must be installed and configured
- Connection to Atlassian JIRA must be established
- JIRA issue validation is MANDATORY for PR documentation

**Cannot proceed with:**
- ❌ Simulated or placeholder JIRA data
- ❌ Manual JIRA information entry
- ❌ Documentation generation without JIRA validation

**Action required:**
Please configure mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP server before creating PR documentation.
```
## �🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - JIRA Issue

**MANDATORY JIRA ISSUE NUMBER REQUIRED:**
- A JIRA issue number is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED to proceed with PR documentation
- If no JIRA issue is provided in the user's request or context, you MUST ask for it
- NEVER create simulated, placeholder, or fake JIRA issue references
- NEVER proceed with documentation generation without a real JIRA issue number
- The format should be: PROJECT-#### (e.g., DEV-123, CRM-456, etc.)

**Stop and ask the user:** "I need a JIRA issue number to create the PR documentation. Please provide the JIRA issue number for this pull request (format: PROJECT-####)."

### JIRA Issue Validation (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**Once JIRA issue number is provided:**

1. **Verify Issue Exists** - Use **mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP** to validate the issue exists
   - Use the `jira_get_issue` tool from mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP
   - Pass the issue number provided by the user (e.g., ISSUE-123)
   - **This call MUST succeed** - If it fails, stop immediately
   - If issue doesn't exist: Stop and show ERROR message
   - If MCP connection fails: Stop and show ERROR message
   - If call succeeds: Store the following context for later verification:
     - Issue key and summary
     - Issue description (full text)
     - Acceptance criteria (if present)
     - All requirements and user stories
     - Comments with additional context
     - Status, priority, and labels
     - Assignee and reporter information

**CRITICAL: The jira_get_issue call is NON-NEGOTIABLE**
```
Required MCP Tool: jira_get_issue
Required Parameter: issue_key (e.g., "ISSUE-123")
Expected Response: Complete JIRA issue object with all fields
On Failure: STOP - Show error and do NOT proceed
On Success: Store complete issue context for requirement validation
```

**ERROR MESSAGE FORMAT when issue validation fails:**
```
❌ JIRA ISSUE VALIDATION FAILED

Issue: [ISSUE-NUMBER]
Status: [NOT FOUND / MCP CONNECTION FAILED]

**Problem:**
[Choose appropriate message:]
- The JIRA issue [ISSUE-NUMBER] does not exist in the system
- Cannot connect to mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP server
- mcp-server-atlassian-jira is not configured or not available

**Cannot proceed with:**
- ❌ PR documentation generation
- ❌ Requirement validation
- ❌ Any documentation work

**Action required:**
[Choose appropriate action:]
- Verify the JIRA issue number is correct
- Configure mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP server
- Ensure JIRA connection is established
```

2. **Fetch Issue Requirements** - Use **mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP** `jira_get_issue` to retrieve:
   - Issue description and summary (from jira_get_issue response)
   - Acceptance criteria (if defined in description or custom fields)
   - Business requirements and user stories (from description)
   - Priority and labels (from jira_get_issue response)
   - Comments with additional context (from jira_get_issue response)
   - **Store ALL retrieved data** for later requirement compliance validation

3. **Store JIRA Context for Verification** - Save the following for later use:
   ```
   JIRA Context to Remember:
   - Issue Key: [From jira_get_issue]
   - Summary: [From jira_get_issue]
   - Description: [Full text from jira_get_issue]
   - Acceptance Criteria: [Extracted from description]
   - Requirements: [All requirements listed in description/comments]
   - Status: [From jira_get_issue]
   - Priority: [From jira_get_issue]
   ```
   This context will be used to validate PR changes against requirements.

4. **Compare PR Changes to Requirements** - Analyze if PR changes address the JIRA requirements:
   - ✅ List requirements that ARE met by the PR changes
   - ⚠️ List requirements that are PARTIALLY met (need clarification)
   - ❌ List requirements that are NOT met by the PR changes
   - Flag any PR changes that don't map to JIRA requirements (scope creep)

4. **Requirement Compliance Check** - Include in final documentation:
   ```markdown
   ## JIRA Requirement Compliance
   
   ### Requirements Met ✅
   - [Requirement 1 from JIRA]: [How PR addresses this]
   - [Requirement 2 from JIRA]: [How PR addresses this]
   
   ### Requirements Partially Met ⚠️
   - [Requirement]: [What's implemented vs. what's missing]
   
   ### Requirements Not Met ❌
   - [Requirement]: [Why not addressed - out of scope, future work, etc.]
   
   ### Out-of-Scope Changes
   - [Change in PR]: [Justification if not in JIRA requirements]
   ```

## Pull Request Change Detection

**Automatically detect and focus ONLY on pull request changes:**

### 1. Git-Aware Change Analysis
- **Detect uncommitted changes** - Modified files in working directory that will be committed
- **Identify branch-specific commits** - Changes committed since branch was created from master/main/base branch
- **Analyze only PR-relevant files** - Skip files unchanged since branch creation
- **Focus on AL objects** - Tables, pages, codeunits, reports, enums created or modified for this PR

### 2. JIRA Issue Details
- **Validate issue exists** - Use **mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP** to confirm issue is exists
- **Fetch comprehensive details** - Use **mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP** to retrieve:
  - Issue description and summary
  - Acceptance criteria and business requirements
  - Comments and additional context
  - Priority, labels, and stakeholders
- **Compare to PR changes** - Validate PR addresses JIRA requirements
- **Flag discrepancies** - Identify requirements not met or out-of-scope changes

### 3. Code Changes Analysis (PR-Focused)
- Analyze git commits and diffs to understand what files were changed in THIS branch
- Compare current state with branch base to identify ALL modifications for the PR
- Examine code patterns and architectural decisions made in the changed files
- Identify new files, modified files, and deleted files specific to this pull request

### 4. Testing Evidence Discovery
- Scan for new or modified test files in commits specific to this PR
- **CRITICAL: If NO test files found, clearly flag this as missing automated tests**
- Identify test procedures and test scenarios added in branch commits
- Check for manual testing documentation in PR-specific commit messages
- Look for edge cases covered in test implementations added to this branch
- Analyze test coverage and regression test updates for PR changes
- **NEVER fabricate or invent test content when no actual tests exist**

### 5. Technical Implementation Context
- Review PR-specific code changes to understand technical approach
- Identify design patterns, events, and architectural decisions made in this branch
- Assess integration points and dependencies affected by PR changes
- Understand configuration and setup requirements introduced in this PR

### 6. Impact Assessment
- Analyze systems and components affected by PR changes
- Identify performance implications of modifications in this branch
- Review security and permission considerations for changed files
- Assess extensibility and maintainability aspects of PR modifications

## Required Input from User

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THESE:**

- **JIRA Issue Number**: [REQUIRED - MUST be provided by user - NEVER simulate or create fake issues]
  - Ask explicitly if not provided: "Please provide the JIRA issue number for this PR"
  - Must be real issue number in format PROJECT-#### (e.g., DEV-123, CRM-456)
  - Use JIRA MCP server to validate and fetch issue details

**Only ask for additional items if cannot be automatically determined:**

- **Special Setup Requirements**: [Only if not evident from PR code changes]
- **Manual Testing Performed**: [Only if not documented in PR commits or tests]
- **Known Limitations**: [Only if not apparent from PR code review]

## Git-Aware Documentation Generation

**PREREQUISITE: JIRA Validation (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE DOCUMENTATION GENERATION)**

Before starting ANY PR documentation work, you MUST:

1. **Connect to mcp-server-atlassian-jira** - Establish connection to JIRA MCP server
   - Use **mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP** for all JIRA operations
   - **Use the `jira_get_issue` tool** with the issue number provided by user
   - If connection fails: Stop and inform user that mcp-server-atlassian-jira is not available or not configured
   - Request JIRA issue number if not already provided

2. **Verify Issue Exists** - Use **mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP** `jira_get_issue` to fetch the issue
   - Call: `jira_get_issue(issue_key="ISSUE-123")` (or user-provided issue number)
   - **This call MUST succeed** - Do NOT proceed if it fails
   - Query JIRA for the provided issue number
   - If issue doesn't exist: Stop and inform user
   - If issue exists: **Store complete response for requirement validation**

3. **Extract All JIRA Requirements** - Get complete issue details from `jira_get_issue` response:
   - Issue summary and description (parse from response)
   - Acceptance criteria (if defined in description or fields)
   - Business requirements and user stories (extract from description)
   - All comments and additional context (from response)
   - Subtasks and related issues (from response links)
   - Priority, labels, and status (from response fields)
   - **REMEMBER THIS CONTEXT** - It will be used to validate PR changes meet requirements

4. **Analyze PR Changes** - Review what was actually implemented:
   - Get list of all files changed in this PR
   - Analyze code modifications and additions
   - Identify what functionality was implemented

5. **Compare Requirements vs. Implementation** - Critical validation step:
   - **Use the stored JIRA context from jira_get_issue response**
   - Compare each requirement from JIRA to actual PR code changes
   - ✅ Identify JIRA requirements that ARE fully addressed by PR changes
   - ⚠️ Identify JIRA requirements that are PARTIALLY addressed (incomplete)
   - ❌ Identify JIRA requirements that are NOT addressed at all (missing)
   - 🔍 Identify PR changes that DON'T map to JIRA requirements (scope creep)
   - **Document the comparison** - Show which JIRA requirements map to which PR changes

6. **Requirement Compliance Report** - Present findings to user:
   ```markdown
   ## JIRA Requirement Validation Results
   
   **JIRA Issue:** [ISSUE-123] - [Issue Summary]
   
   ### ✅ Requirements Fully Implemented
   - [Requirement 1]: [What was implemented]
   - [Requirement 2]: [What was implemented]
   
   ### ⚠️ Requirements Partially Implemented
   - [Requirement 3]: [What's done] | [What's missing]
   
   ### ❌ Requirements NOT Implemented
   - [Requirement 4]: [Why not addressed]
   
   ### 🔍 Out-of-Scope Changes (Not in JIRA)
   - [PR Change]: [Justification needed]
   
   **Action Required:** 
   - If requirements are missing: Should they be implemented before creating PR?
   - If out-of-scope changes exist: Should they be removed or documented?
   ```

7. **Get User Confirmation** - Do NOT proceed until user confirms:
   - "The JIRA requirements analysis is complete. Do you want to proceed with PR documentation generation, or do you need to make additional code changes first?"

**ONLY AFTER USER CONFIRMATION, proceed to documentation generation steps below.**

---

**STEP 1: Consult taylor-docs specialist**
After JIRA validation is complete and user confirms, use `mcp_bc-code-intel_ask_bc_expert` with `preferred_specialist: "taylor-docs"` to:
- Get guidance on BC documentation standards for this specific PR
- Ensure documentation structure follows best practices
- Validate that all required sections will be properly addressed

**STEP 2: Generate PR description content (NOT a separate file)**
After consulting taylor-docs, generate the PR description text by analyzing ONLY the changes in this pull request.

**CRITICAL: DO NOT create a separate PR-DOCUMENTATION.md file!**
**CRITICAL: Use the documentation content DIRECTLY in the PR description when creating the PR!**
**CRITICAL: Keep descriptions CONCISE - Azure DevOps has length limits!**
**CRITICAL: Use ONLY headings, lists, and emoticons - NO code blocks, NO tables!**
**CRITICAL: NEVER EXCEED 3800 CHARACTERS - Count characters before creating PR!**

Generate the following content structure for the PR description (simplified format):

```markdown
# [Emoticon] [JIRA-ISSUE]: [Title]

## [Section with emoticon]
- Bullet points only
- No code blocks
- No tables
- Keep concise

## Summary
Brief paragraph summarizing the change

## Changes
- List of changes
- Organized by category
- With emoticons for visual clarity

## Testing
- Manual testing results
- List format only
- Include success indicators

## Deployment
- Prerequisites
- Steps
- Configuration

## Assessment
- Architecture ratings in list format
- Overall recommendation
- Risk level

---

Commit info
```

**FORMAT RESTRICTIONS:**
- ✅ Headings (# ## ###)
- ✅ Bullet lists (- or numbered)
- ✅ Emoticons (⚠️ ✅ ⭐ 🔧 📋 etc.)
- ✅ Bold text
- ❌ NO code blocks or backticks
- ❌ NO tables with pipes
- ❌ **CRITICAL: NEVER exceed 3800 characters total length**
- ❌ NO complex formatting

**⚠️ CHARACTER LIMIT WARNING:**
- **HARD LIMIT: 3800 characters maximum**
- Azure DevOps will truncate content beyond this limit
- Always count characters before creating PR
- Prioritize essential information if approaching limit
- Use concise language and abbreviations when necessary

**IMPLEMENTATION - CREATE PR WITH AZURE REST API:**

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use Azure REST API via az rest - NEVER use az repos pr create/update**

The `az repos pr` commands have a known bug with multi-line text. Use the REST API method from the start:

```powershell
# Step 1: Generate description content (CRITICAL: keep under 3800 characters)
$description = @"
# PR Title

## Section 1
Content here

## Section 2
More content
"@

# Step 2: Create JSON body file
$title = "Your PR Title"
$sourceBranch = "refs/heads/your-branch"
$targetBranch = "refs/heads/master"

$prBody = @{
    sourceRefName = $sourceBranch
    targetRefName = $targetBranch
    title = $title
    description = $description
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

$prBody | Out-File -FilePath "pr-create.json" -Encoding UTF8

# Step 3: Create PR using Azure REST API
$prResult = az rest --method POST `
  --uri "https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_apis/git/repositories/{repoId}/pullrequests?api-version=7.1" `
  --body "@pr-create.json" `
  --headers "Content-Type=application/json" `
  --resource "499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798" | ConvertFrom-Json

# Step 4: Clean up
Remove-Item "pr-create.json"

# Get PR ID for reference
$prId = $prResult.pullRequestId
Write-Host "PR Created: #$prId"
```

```

**Result:** Complete, professional PR documentation with all 5 mandatory components, generated automatically with minimal human input, focusing exclusively on pull request changes.

## 🔍 Pre-Documentation Validation

**Before starting ANY documentation generation, validate:**

1. **JIRA Issue Check**: Is a real JIRA issue number provided?
   - ❌ NO JIRA Issue = Stop and ask for it
   - ❌ Simulated/Placeholder Issue = Stop and ask for real one
   - ✅ Real JIRA Issue (PROJECT-####) = Proceed with validation

1a. **JIRA Issue Validation** (via mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP):
   - ❌ Issue doesn't exist = Stop and inform user
   - ❌ MCP connection failed = Stop and inform user that mcp-server-atlassian-jira is required
   - ✅ Issue exists and retrieved = Proceed with requirement analysis

1b. **JIRA Requirement Analysis** (via mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP):
   - Extract acceptance criteria and requirements from JIRA
   - Compare PR changes to JIRA requirements
   - Flag any gaps or discrepancies
   - Identify out-of-scope changes

2. **Test Coverage Check**: Are there actual automated tests in the PR?
   - ❌ NO Tests Found = Use warning format in Testing Documentation section
   - ❌ NEVER invent or fabricate test content when none exists
   - ✅ Real Tests Found = Document actual test procedures and coverage

3. **Never Create Fake Content**: 
   - NEVER use text like "Simulated - actual JIRA integration would be via MCP server"
   - NEVER create placeholder content like "DEV-2024-ESC (Simulated)"
   - NEVER fabricate test procedures, frameworks, or coverage when none exist
   - ALWAYS use **mcp-server-atlassian-jira MCP** for real JIRA integration when JIRA issue is provided
   - ALWAYS accurately represent testing state (including lack of tests)
   - If mcp-server-atlassian-jira is not available, STOP and inform user - do NOT proceed with fake data
